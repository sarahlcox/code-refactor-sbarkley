# code-refactor-sbarkley

This is my final product for the code refactor assignment. I took the existing code to make it more consise, and accessible in accordance with the request of the marketing agency. I have added alt text of the description of images, and have consolidated some code, as well as added comments and reorganized the code in the proper structure.
